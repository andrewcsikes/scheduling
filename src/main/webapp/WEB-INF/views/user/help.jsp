<h1>
	Scheduling Information. 
</h1>

<p>You can manage your user information by clicking on the 'My Account' tab in the menu at the top of this page. 
From there, you can change your account username and password along with your contact information.</p>

<p>There are 2 types of schedules and you can get to them from the drop down menu labeled 'Schedule.' 
The first type is the calendar view which gives you a view of all the fields for the week with time slots for 
each half hour. From this page is where you will manage your schedule. The 
<img src='/images/plus-icon.png' /> means that slot is available. By clicking on the 
<img src='/images/plus-icon.png' />, you are scheduling your team for that half hour time 
slot on the that field. If the slot is already taken, there will not be a 
<img src='/images/plus-icon.png' />; instead, you will see the team that has the slot reserved. 
If your team is the team that has the slot reserved, you will also see a 
<img src='/images/minus-icon.png' />. This is how you remove your team from that time slot.

<p>The other type of schedule is the list view. This view shows in list format all the times reserved for a particular month.
You can filter the list by team, month, and team type.

<p>For now, each 6U, 8U, and 10U team is limited to 3 hours of practice/week. The 12U and 14U teams are limited 
to 4 hours.

<p>You must be logged in to access any of the pages. If you have any issues or need further help, please don't hesitate to contact Andrew Sikes</p>
